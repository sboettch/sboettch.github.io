## Exercise 1: Missing Persons in the US

- Create a useable dataframe based on publicly available data
- R review
- Pandas and Altair review

### Idea

According to [NamUs](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/), around 600,000 people in the US go missing every year. [A majority of cases involve missing juveniles](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/23/fbi-releases-unsolved-missing-persons-cases-list-need-fresh-leads/5800079001/).

For further reading, see the FBI's [2019 NCIC Missing Person and Unidentified Person Statistics](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2019-ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics.pdf/view).

We are interested in understanding the breakdown of missing persons cases in the US. A raw dataset was exported by performing the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Navigate to [NamUs](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/). Login or register (as Public)/activate/login.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) [Dashboard > Search (default- Missing Persons, no further entry specification)](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Search#/results) brings us to the option to export all cases (10,000).
  
### Questions
